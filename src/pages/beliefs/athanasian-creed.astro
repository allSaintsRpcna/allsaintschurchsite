        <p class="creed-blurb">A detailed creed on the doctrines of the Trinity and the incarnation, historically attributed to Athanasius of Alexandria.</p>

        <div class="creed-text">
          <p><span class="creed-num">1.</span> Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">2.</span> Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">3.</span> And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">4.</span> Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">5.</span> For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">6.</span> But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">7.</span> Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">8.</span> The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">9.</span> The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">10.</span> The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">11.</span> And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">12.</span> As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but one uncreated and one incomprehensible.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">13.</span> So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">14.</span> And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">15.</span> So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">16.</span> And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">17.</span> So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">18.</span> And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">19.</span> For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">20.</span> So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three Gods or three Lords.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">21.</span> The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">22.</span> The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">23.</span> The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">24.</span> So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">25.</span> And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or less than another.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">26.</span> But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">27.</span> So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">28.</span> He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.</p>
          <p class="creed-break"><span class="creed-num">29.</span> Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">30.</span> For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">31.</span> God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and man of substance of His mother, born in the world.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">32.</span> Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">33.</span> Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His manhood.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">34.</span> Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">35.</span> One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of that manhood into God.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">36.</span> One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">37.</span> For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">38.</span> Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">39.</span> He ascended into heaven, He sits on the right hand of the Father, God, Almighty;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">40.</span> From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">41.</span> At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">42.</span> and shall give account of their own works.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">43.</span> And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.</p>
          <p><span class="creed-num">44.</span> This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved.</p>
