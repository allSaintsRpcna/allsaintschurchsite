        All Saints Reformed Presbyterian Church is a growing body of worshipers
        consisting of believers and their children. From the early days of our
        humble beginnings, All Saints has aimed to reach the lost in our area and
        to welcome those seeking fellowship with a church which loves Jesus
        Christ and the truth He has revealed in Scripture.
